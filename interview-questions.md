Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:
oop... you know me ...
oop is ruby because it uses objects in its functioning. functional programing is programing that uses functions functionally. Im not entirly sure honestly
Researched answer:
Object-oriented programming is a programming approach that utilizes objects, which are instances of classes, to manage and manipulate data. Unlike functional programming, which centers on evaluating mathematical functions, object-oriented programming emphasizes the organization of data and behavior into objects.
2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:
floats are decimal values and integers are whole numbers
Researched answer:
In Ruby, a Float is a type of number that includes a decimal point, while an Integer is a whole number that does not have a decimal point.
3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:
you dont have to state 'return', the program does it implicitly 
Researched answer:
An implicit return in Ruby is a form of return statement that automatically returns the last expression evaluated within a method, without requiring an explicit return keyword.
4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:
not really clear on the definition. I would assume its a package of code. 
Researched answer:
A block in Ruby is a code structure that enables the grouping of code and the passing of it as an argument to a method. It shares similarities with a lambda or anonymous function in other programming languages.
5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:
'#{value}' 
Researched answer:
In Ruby, you can extract a value from a hash by accessing its key using square brackets or the fetch method. For instance, to extract the value associated with the "name" key in a hash called "person," you may use either person["name"] or person.fetch("name").
